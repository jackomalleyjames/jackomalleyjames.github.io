								</div>
								<p>My journey into the world of astrobiology began with a 
childhood love of space and plants, which grew and developed into 
interests that now lie firmly at the intersection between astronomy, 
biology and geophysics. A perfect place from which to explore questions 
about how life would influence a planet's atmosphere, climate, 
appearance and detectable signs of life (biosignatures). My research has
 encompassed everything from exploring exotic forms of photosynthesis on
 planets with two suns, to investigating the types of biospheres that 
could thrive on UV-irradiated worlds, and even looking at where the last
 puddle on Earth may be in the far-future and what this would mean for 
the search for life in the Universe. Interest in this kind of research 
reaches far beyond the scientific world, providing me with many public 
outreach opportunities through the written word, television, radio or 
science events. The more time I spend exploring these questions and 
talking to people about them, the more I am aware that they not only 
help us to determine how to search for life on distant alien worlds, but
 can also help us to build on our understanding of the complex interplay
 between the atmosphere, geosphere and biosphere here on Earth. This 
connection between other worlds and our own has been a significant 
driving force behind much of what I do.

<p>Astrobiology is concerned with the search for life beyond Earth, as 
well as the origins, limits and future of life in the Universe. It is 
truly interdisciplinary in scope, encompassing astronomy, biology, 
chemistry, geophysics and many other disciplines. In my work - initially
 at the University of St Andrews, then at the Carl Sagan Institute, 
Cornell University - I act as a bridge between astronomy and biology. I 
focus on using Earth as a template for how life would interact with the 
atmospheres and surfaces of habitable exoplanets. This involves using 
Earth-like ecosystems as a basis for envisioning possible 
extraterrestrial biospheres by finding the overlaps between the 
environments life has adapted to on Earth (or to which evolutionary 
biology suggests that life could adapt given the right 'push') and the 
environments we predict for potentially habitable exoplanets. These 
alien-but-familiar biospheres then become components of climate or 
photochemistry models to simulate how less Earth-like life might be 
detected.</p>

<p>One aspect of this involves studying the impact stellar evolution may
 have on the biospheres of planets in the habitable zone of their star 
(the region around a star where temperatures are just right for liquid 
water to exist). These impacts include how life would adapt to changing 
conditions over geological time, how remotely detectable biosignatures 
would change and, ultimately, when all life on a planet would come to an
 end. Another aspect of my research involves investigating how 
frequently-flaring, active red dwarf stars would affect the biologically
 harmful ultraviolet radiation fluxes on any closely orbiting habitable 
zone rocky planets, as well as the mechanisms life could employ to 
survive such harsh environments.</p>

<p>It is important to know how the signs of life change over a planet’s 
habitable lifetime, or how they could differ for the full range of 
possible habitable environments that could exist on rocky exoplanets. 
Near-future habitable exoplanet discoveries will not all be similar to 
the present-day Earth. Some may host younger, simpler biospheres, others
 may host older, dying biospheres, while others may host more alien 
biospheres, hardened to high radiation levels, or other extremes. 
Different subsets of the distribution of possible habitable environments
 could lead to life that is very different to the life we see on Earth 
today. Consequently, these scenarios will produce very different sets of
 biosignatures. Knowing what signatures to look for from these worlds 
will increase the chances of confirming the presence of life on a planet
 beyond our solar system.</p>

<div class="col-md-6 animate-box fadeInUp animated">
<img class="img-responsive about-img" src="index2_files/modelworlds.png">
</div>

<p>These types of project require the blending together of knowledge 
from a wide range of fields, such as stellar evolution, planetary 
geophysics, atmospheric physics, biological evolution, environmental 
biology and ecology. Putting strands of different science together in 
this way to imagine alien worlds leads to new and novel ideas, as well 
as some very interesting collaborations. Perhaps even more importantly, 
it can give us new perspectives on our own planet and the fragile 
interplay of life, geosphere and atmosphere that makes it not just 
habitable, but home.</p>

										<h2>The Future of Life on Earth</h2>
<p></p>
                <p>Earth is the only inhabited planet we know of, which 
makes it our only template for how a living world works. The geological 
record provides a guide to how a young habitable planet may look and how
 it may evolve with time. Earth today shows us how a middle-aged world 
with a rich biosphere operates. But what about the later stages of a 
living planet's lifetime? By looking at how stars like the Sun age, we 
can predict what conditions might be like on Earth millions, hundreds of
 millions and even billions of years from now. This gives us clues about
 what types of life could and could not live there and ultimately tells 
us how long a habitable planet can actually remain habitable.</p>

										<h2>Photosynthetic Life on Other Worlds</h2>
<p></p>
                <p>Sunlight is an abundant energy source on Earth's 
surface that life very quickly figured out how to use as a fuel. On 
another habitable world, star light is likely to be an equally rich free
 energy source. So, if life were to evolve on another planet, it would 
not be surprising if it came up with something like photosynthesis to 
take advantage of this free food. Photosynthesis has the power to change
 atmospheric composition and vegetation itself has unique reflectance 
properties that can change the appearance of a planet's surface. By 
exploring how plant life might work on other worlds, we bring ourselves a
 step closer to knowing how to find some of the biggest fingerprints 
that life can leave behind on a planet.</p>

										<h2>The Habitability of Red Dwarf Star Systems</h2>
<p></p>
                <p>Red dwarf stars (M type stars) are the most common 
type of star in the galaxy and most of the habitable planets we know 
about (to date) have red dwarf suns. So understanding how life would 
work in these systems is important for guiding our first 
biosignature-hunting missions. However, these stars, though cooler and 
fainter than the Sun, provide some interesting challenges for life as we
 know it in the form of large stellar flares and harsh ultraviolet 
radiation. Looking at how life on Earth copes under similar pressures 
can tell us a lot about what we may find on these alien worlds.</p>

										<p>As a guide to how to look for life on other planets, there 
is no need to look any further than your own back garden. Whether it 
sprawls over countless acres or is compacted into a small balcony, a 
garden artfully demonstrates the theories, methods and tools

 people settled new lands, they brought their vines with them, spreading
 viticulture across the world. If and when people settle on Mars (an 
idea that’s gradually moving away from the realms of fantasy and 
becoming a real possibility) they will almost certainly want to continue
 this trend...</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.jackomalleyjames.com/post5.html"> How interesting would the discovery of alien microbes really be?</a></h2>
										<p>Recent evidence suggests microbial life may have been 
present on Mars, deep in that planet’s past. Some microbes have been 
exposed to space and survived, suggesting they are tough enough to 
endure incredibly harsh conditions If life is something that originates 
easily, then it is probably only a matter of time before...</p>

										<h2><a href="http://www.jackomalleyjames.com/post4.html"> Where did all the water come from? </a></h2>
										<p>It was recently announced that the Rosetta space mission to
 the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko found that water contained by the 
comet did not resemble water on Earth. This has added to evidence that 
comets probably did not deliver the oceans to our planet billions of 
years ago when it first formed. In that case, where did all the water 
come from..?</p>

										<h2><a href="http://www.jackomalleyjames.com/post3.html">Life in the Air</a></h2>
										<p>On Earth, life has managed to find a foothold in a range of
 seemingly inhospitable environments. Often the most extreme of 
environments are solely the domain of microbes; from the hot, 
high-pressure environments of deep sea vents, to the insides of nuclear 
reactors, but not always. There are also ice worms that spend their 
lives in glacial ice, so adapted to the cold that they would melt in 
your hand if picked up...</p>

										<h2><a href="http://www.jackomalleyjames.com/post1.html">Will we really find any signs of life beyond Earth?</a></h2>
										<p>Astrobiology is a science with little to no evidence. We 
know there is life here on Earth and, because Earth is in no way 
separate to the rest of the universe, we know that there is life in the 
universe. However, when it comes to looking for life beyond Earth we 
really have nothing much to go on...yet. By studying life on Earth we 
know increasingly more about where life could live...</p>

									<h2><a href="http://www.jackomalleyjames.com/post11.html">A Clarification on CO2 and the End of the World</a></h2>
										<p>As a guide to how to look for life on other planets, there 
is no need to look any further than your own back garden. Whether it 
sprawls over countless acres or is compacted into a small balcony, a 
garden artfully demonstrates the theories, methods and tools 
astrobiologists use in their search for alien life on worlds far beyond 
Earth. A garden is a cultivated space, forever being nudged away from 
the wilderness it desires to become by the hand that shapes it.</p>

									<h2><a href="http://www.jackomalleyjames.com/post10.html">A Clarification on CO2 and the End of the World</a></h2>
										<p>In the past few years, I have noticed my name cited in 
articles that attempt to debunk climate science. I ignored it at first, 
working on the assumption that most people either would never read these
 articles anyway, or would at least see through the agendas behind them.
 However, more recently, there has been a notable increase in such 
articles  – particularly from within a certain country post-2017 ...</p>

									<h2><a href="http://www.jackomalleyjames.com/post9.html">Brexit and the Search for Life in the Universe</a></h2>
										<p>At first glance there seems to be little connecting Brexit 
with the search for life on other worlds (beyond, perhaps an impact on 
the funding of and involvement in that search). However, given time to 
think on it, odd parallels between the two begin to emerge. Over the 
three-and-a-bit years since the day of the June 2016 referendum, 
constant wall-to-wall media coverage of the UK’s plodding, tortoise-like
