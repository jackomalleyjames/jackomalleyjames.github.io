				</h1>
				
				<p>Recent evidence suggests microbial life may have been present on Mars, deep in that planetâ€™s past. Some microbes have been 
exposed to space and survived, suggesting they are tough enough to endure incredibly harsh conditions...</p>

We know there is life here on Earth and, because Earth is in no way separate to the rest of the universe, we know that there is life in the universe. However, when it comes to looking for life beyond Earth we really have nothing much to go on...yet. By studying life on Earth we know increasingly more about where life could live...</p>
